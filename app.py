##### VARK model has four learning style categories : Aural, Kinesthetic, Reader & Visual \n 
A brief description of these learning styles can be found below: \n
 
1) Visual: visual learners like to be provided demonstrations and can \n
learn through descriptions. They like to use lists to maintain pace \n
and organise their thoughts. They remember faces but often forget \n
names. They are distracted by movement or action but noise \n
usually does not bother them. \n
2) Aural: aural learners learn by listening. They like to be provided\ n
with aural instructions. They enjoy aural discussions and \n
dialogues and prefer to work out problems by talking. They are \n
easily distracted by noise. \n
3) Read/write: read/write learners are note takers. They do best by \n
taking notes during a lecture or reading difficult material. They \n
often draw things to remember them. They do well with hands-on \n
projects or tasks. \n
4) Kinesthetic: kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. Their \n
preference is for hands-on experiences. They are often high \n
energy and like to make use of touching, moving and interacting \n
with their environment. They prefer not to watch or listen and \n
generally do not do well in the classroom. \n

A pre trained Decision Tree Model is running on the backend of this website\n
During evaluation of the model, it gave the following f1 score for the mentioned VARK categories respectively: \n
